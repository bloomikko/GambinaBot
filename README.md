# GambinaBot
Twitter bot for getting amount of available Gambina in random Alko (the liquor distributor in Finland). For the love of 'rubiininpunainen suudelma', Gambina, the famous drink. Many people have quite experiences with it. I'm an active Twitter user and there are a lot of interesting bots, and this is my third bot as there are no love for Gambina, yet. Now there is!

Bot also running at https://twitter.com/gambinabot on my Raspberry Pi.

# Features
  - Gets Gambina amount from a random store
  - When getting the store, checks whether it has been used in last 48 hours (maintained by a pickle file)
  - Forms a tweet with the amount of Gambina and the name of store
  - Posting every hour, this also can be modified
  
 # What did I do/learn?
  - Python basics revise ðŸ˜‰
  - How bots overall work (my third one!)
